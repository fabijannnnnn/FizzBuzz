# FizzBuzz Program

This is a simple implementation of the FizzBuzz problem in C++, along with a basic test.

## Usage

The program prints numbers from 1 to 100, replacing multiples of 3 with "Fizz", multiples of 5 with "Buzz", and multiples of both with "FizzBuzz".

To run the program:
- Compile the `main.cpp` file.
- Execute the compiled binary.

## Tests

The program includes a basic test that verifies the correctness of the FizzBuzz output for different inputs.
